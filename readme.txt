Shortcode to include images from Screenshot Machine in your content.

== Description ==

**Shortcode to include images from [Screenshot Machine](http://screenshotmachine.com/) in your content.**

Use the `ssm` shortcode in your content with the following arguments:

* `key="{customer key}"`
* `url="{url}"`
* `dimension="{width x height}"` (default is 120x90)
* `device="{desktop|phone|tablet}"` (default is desktop)
* `format="{jpg|png|gif}"` (default is jpg)
* `days="{cache expiration}"` (default is 14)
* `wait="{wait in ms}"` (default is 200)
* `title="{href title}"`
* `link="{yes|no}"` (default is yes)
* `target="{frame name}"` (default is _blank)
* `refresh="{yes|no}"` (default is yes)

You can find the `{customer key}` on [your Screenshot Machine customer profile](https://www.screenshotmachine.com/account.php).

The `{url}` is the web page URL you want to capture in the screenshot.

Example dimension values:

* `320x240` - screenshot size 320x240 pixels
* `800x600` - screenshot size 800x600 pixels
* `1024x768` - screenshot size 1024x768 pixels
* `1920x1080` - screenshot size 1920x1080 pixels
* `1024xfull` - full page screenshot with width equals to 1024 pixels (can be pretty long)

Example device and dimension values:

* `device="desktop"` and `dimension="1024x768"` - desktop screenshot with size 1024x768 pixels
* `device="phone"` and `dimension="480x800"` - mobile phone screenshot with size 480x800 pixels
* `device="tablet"` and `dimension="800x1280"` - tablet screenshot with size 800x1280 pixels

The format `{jpeg|png|gif}` is an image format to use for the screenshot (default is jpg).

The `{cache expiration}` is a number of days a screenshot should be used before a new one is created (default is 14).

The `{wait in ms}` is a number of milliseconds to wait before capturing the screenshot (default is 200).

The `{href title}` is a title text for the image alt and title attributes.

The link `{yes|no}` value will determine if the image is linked to the web page URL or not.

The target `{frame name}` default value opens the link in a new window/tab. An empty string, "_self", "_top", "_parent", or an HTML frame name are also valid values.

The refresh `{yes|no}` value includes javascript to retry the image every second until it's available (for a maximum of 10 seconds).

Example shortcode:

<pre>&#91;ssm key="abc123" url="https://google.com/" dimension="800x600"&#93;</pre>
